description: Drive Roblox Studio through its built-in MCP server to inspect the data model, run Luau, run Tier-2 in-engine specs, and smoke-test before handing a build to Dariy. Use when running in-engine specs, "smoke-test in Studio", checking instances/constraints/network ownership actually got created, or connecting Claude to Studio.

# Studio MCP — your eyes and hands inside the engine

Modern Studio ships an **MCP server** that lets you act *inside the open place*: read the
DataModel, insert/modify instances, run Luau, and automate play-tests. This is how you
smoke-test Tier-2 behavior **before** handing a build to Dariy.

## One-time connect

1. In Studio: **File → Studio Settings → Beta Features → enable "MCP Server"** (also under
   **Assistant → MCP Servers → Enable Studio as MCP server**). It listens on `localhost:3004`.
2. Register with Claude Code: `claude mcp add roblox-studio --transport http http://localhost:3004/mcp`
3. Keep Studio open with the place loaded — MCP operates on the **currently open place**, and
   changes happen live so Dariy can watch.

## What to use it for

- **Inspect:** confirm the things your code is supposed to create actually exist — e.g. after
  equip (Issue #4): does the sword exist as an unanchored part with `AlignPosition` +
  `AlignOrientation`, and did `SetNetworkOwner` actually assign the owning client?
- **Run Luau:** execute a snippet to check a value or reproduce a bug without a full play-test.
- **Tier-2 specs:** run `*.spec.luau` (Jest-Lua/TestEZ) that need real Instances/physics, and
  report pass/fail before handoff.

## The boundary that keeps the project sane

The **filesystem (Rojo + Git) stays the source of truth.** Use MCP to *inspect, run, and
test* — but don't author game code by mutating the live DataModel and leaving it there. Any
change worth keeping goes back into a `.luau` file, committed. An older standalone
`studio-rust-mcp-server` exists as reference; the **built-in** server is the recommended path.

## Before handoff to Dariy

Report exactly what you smoke-tested in-engine and what you saw, then give him the manual
checklist from the issue. Never hand off "should work in Studio" — open it and check.
