# /retro — look back, learn, celebrate

After finishing something real (an issue closed, a PR merged, a feature that finally *feels* right),
take two minutes to capture what you learned. This is how the project gets smarter over time instead
of relearning the same lessons.

## Do this

1. Append an entry to **`docs/retro-log.md`** using the template below (create the file if it's missing).
2. If something you learned is reusable, say: *"this could be a new skill"* and offer to add one to
   `.claude/skills/`.
3. **Celebrate the win out loud** with Dariy — name what he accomplished. Green tests and merged PRs
   are real milestones; don't be flat about them.

## Template (append to docs/retro-log.md)

```markdown
## <date> — Issue #<n>: <short title>

- ✅ **Went well:** <what worked — a clean test, a good design choice, a bug caught early>
- ⚠️ **Was hard / would do differently:** <what slowed us down, what we'd change>
- 💡 **Learned:** <one concrete thing — a Roblox API quirk, a tuning value, a workflow tweak>
- 🎉 **Win:** <the thing Dariy can be proud of>
```

## Keep it short and honest

4–6 lines. Real wins *and* real stumbles — a retro that only lists wins teaches nothing. If a play-test
felt off and we fixed it, that's a great retro entry (and probably a regression test too).

## Why it matters

You're 15 once and building your first real game — noticing *how* you got better is half the fun and
all of the learning. Future-you (and future-Claude) read this log and skip the mistakes.
